## üõ†Ô∏è Virtualization Stack

- **Proxmox VE** on all nodes
- **Ubuntu** as the primary VM OS
- **LXC containers** for Media, DevOps tools, sysadmin services
- **Windows Server & Windows 11** test environments
- **AI Workloads** run inside Ubuntu VMs with Docker + CUDA

---

## üß± Storage Layout

- 2x Dell 60-bay JBODs (~2PB) directly attached via HBA to R720XD #1
- Media content and daily snapshots backed up to R720XD #2
- ZFS used for data integrity and snapshots

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Network & Access

- **pfSense** handles WAN, LAN, VLANs, DNS, DHCP
- **Tailscale** provides secure remote access across devices
- VLANs isolate traffic (Management, Storage, AI, Media, Remote Access)
- Management via Proxmox Web UI + SSH

---

## üß™ Use Cases

- Infrastructure prototyping
- Script development + automation (Bash, Python)
- AI experimentation (text, vision models)
- Storage benchmarking
- Homelab documentation for GitHub

---

## üîó Future Plans

- Deploy Kubernetes across GPU + storage nodes
- Implement Grafana/Prometheus for advanced monitoring
- Publish Terraform modules for full infrastructure replication
- Public GitHub repo for open-source homelab playbooks
